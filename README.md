I enjoy working on projects that provide utility, webpages, and other projects I find interesting (ex: Mandelbrot set GUI application). It is my intent to commit to taking a TDD approach to my projects as much as possible from now on. I primarily use/work with Java, but oftentimes when working on web applications I will use PHP.
